Q. What is JIT?
Ans
JIT refers to " Just in time compiler " . 
It converts byte code into machine code that can be send directly to the 
machine .
After you have written a program the source code are compiled by the java compiler into bytecode 
rather than into code that contains instructions that match a particular hardware platform's processor.
